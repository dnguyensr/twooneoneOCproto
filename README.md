# twooneoneOCproto [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dnguyensr/twooneoneOCproto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dnguyensr/twooneoneOCproto)

twooneoneOCproto is a web app that provides information for those in immediate need of food and shelter. It will utilize information from sites like [Orange County 211](www.211oc.org) to offer a more intuitive way to find more information, locate, and map out locations that offer immediate resources in Orange County, CA.  The scope of the site will change as feedback is gained and if it is found useful, it may be expanded to include companion sites that offer resources for less urgent needs as well as resources for those that wish to donate.
